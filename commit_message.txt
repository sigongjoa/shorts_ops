Refactor: Use Google Docs as sole source of truth for project data

This major refactoring shifts project and short data persistence from local files (projects.json) to Google Docs, making Google Docs the sole source of truth.

Key changes include:
- Backend (`backend/server.js`):
    - `GET /api/projects`: Now fetches project data by listing and parsing Google Docs.
    - `POST /api/projects`: Creates a new Google Doc for the project and initializes it with a template (including project description).
    - `PUT /api/projects/:projectId`: Updates project name and description directly in the Google Doc.
    - `DELETE /api/projects/:projectId`: Deletes the corresponding Google Doc.
    - Removed reliance on `projects.json` for project data.
- Backend (`backend/src/api/docs/docs.controller.js`):
    - Implemented `updateShortContentInDoc` to update short details within the Google Doc.
    - Implemented `deleteShortFromDocument` to remove short sections from the Google Doc.
- Backend (`backend/src/services/docs/docHelpers.js`):
    - `initDocumentTemplate` now accepts `projectDescription` for initial document setup.
- Frontend (`src/services/youtube-shorts-content-factory/`):
    - `localStorageService.ts` renamed to `projectService.ts`.
    - `projectService.ts` now uses backend API calls for all project CRUD operations.
- Frontend Components:
    - `src/youtube-shorts-content-factory/App.tsx`: Adapted to use `projectService`.
    - `src/components/youtube-shorts-content-factory/ProjectView.tsx`:
        - `handleAddNewShort` now sets `newShort.googleDocId` to the project's `driveDocumentId`.
        - Added `handleDeleteShort` to remove shorts from the Google Doc.
    - `src/components/youtube-shorts-content-factory/ShortCard.tsx`: Added a delete button for shorts.
    - `src/components/youtube-shorts-content-factory/ShortDetailModal.tsx`: Ensures the "Create New Google Doc" button is hidden if a project-level document is linked.

This refactoring addresses persistence issues, ensures a single source of truth, and resolves previous bugs related to duplicate document creation and empty documents.
